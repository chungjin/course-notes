# Lecture 18 Bitcoin

## Background
Problem:
- Many participants maybe not reliable
  Peers can join and leave frequently.

The aim of the design:
- publish a log of all transactions
  ensure everyone sees the same log (in same order!)
  ensure transaction cannot un-publish


## Term Explanation
what's in a transaction record?
- pub(user1): public key of new owner
  hash(prev): hash of this coin's previous transaction record
  sig(user2): signature over transaction by previous owner's private key
  (BitCoin is more complex: amount (fractional), multiple in/out, ...)

Transaction Example:
```
  Y owns a coin, previously given to it by X:
      T6: pub(X), ...
      T7: pub(Y), hash(T6), sig(X)
  Y buys a hamburger from Z and pays with this coin
    Z sends public key to Y
    Y creates a new transaction and signs it
    T8: pub(Z), hash(T7), sig(Y)
  Y sends transaction record to Z
  Z verifies:
    T8's sig(Y) corresponds to T7's pub(Y)
  Z gives hamburger to Y
```  


Only the transactions exist, not the coins themselves
- Z's "balance" is set of unspent transactions for which Z knows private key
  the "identity" of a coin is the (hash of) its most recent xaction

## BitCoin block chain
Block:
- Content:
```
  hash(prevblock)
  set of transactions
  "nonce" (can be anything, as we'll see)
  current time (wall clock timestamp)
```  
- new block every 10 minutes containing xactions since prev block  

"Mining" via "Proof-of-work":
- it is a way to create new block
- requirement: hash(block) has N leading zeros
  each peer tries random nonce values until this works out.
  the winner floods the new block to all peers
- it would likely take one CPU months to create one block
  but thousands of peers are working on it
  more leading zero means it require more compute resources to get the nonce

Fork Problem:

- how to form it?
  + two peers find nonces at about the same time, or
  + or slow network, 2nd block found before 1st is known

The transactions in both B7' and B7'' are valid

- switch to longer chain
    + if two successors, the blockchain temporarily forks
    peers work on whichever block they heard first
    but **switch to longer chain** if they become aware of one
- what about transactions in the abandoned fork?
  - most will be in both forks
  but some may be in just the abandoned fork -- appear, then disappear!
  - so usually, Z will wait for a while, until Z sees Y->Z with a few blocks after it, which means it's very unlikely that it could be overtaken later. Then confirm the transactions is successfully flooded to other peers. But not 100% sure.
