# Lecture 19 Blockstack

## Background
what's a decentralized app?
- apps built in a way that moves ownership of data into users's hands and out of centrally-controlled web sites
  there are many recent (and older) explorations of this general vision.
  the success (and properties) of Bitcoin has prompted a lot of recent activity

Decentralized apps:
- this architecture separates app code from user data
  the big interface division is between user+app and data
  so there's a clearer notion of a user's data, owned/controlled by user
  much as you own the data on your laptop, or in your Athena account
- requirements for the storage system
  in the cloud, so can be accessed from any device
  general-purpose, like a file system
  paid for and controlled by user who owns the data
  sharing between users, modulo permissions, for multi-user apps
  sharing between a user's apps, modulo permissions
  similar to existing services like Amazon S3

How to share data?
- if both u1, u2 want to share some data
  a public storage system, key/value data owned by each of U1 and U2

Problem:
- decentralization is painful:
   per-user FS-like storage much less flexible than dedicated SQL DB
   no trusted server to e.g. look at auction bids w/o revealing
   cryptographic privacy/authentication makes everything else harder
   awkward for users as well as programmers
- current web site architecture works very well
   easy to program
   central control over software+data makes changes (and debugging) easy
   good solutions for performance, reliability
   easy to impose application-specific security
   successful revenue model (ads)

## Blockstack

The usage of naming:
- names correspond to human users, e.g. "jinzhang"
  name -> location (in Gaia) of user's data, so multiple users can interact
  name -> public key, for end-to-end data security

Blockstack store the name(unique user record) to block chain, so as to build a **unique, decentralized, human-readable**, naming system.

Overview of Blockstack system:

- client, browser, application, blockstack.js
- Blockstack Browser (meant to run on client machine)
- Bitcoin's block-chain
- Blockstack servers
  + read Bitcoin chain
  interpret Blockstack naming records to update DB
  serve naming RPCs from clients
  name -> pub key + zone hash
- Atlas servers -- store "zone records"
  + a name record in bitcoin maps to a zone record in Atlas
  zone record indicates where my Gaia data is stored
  keyed by content-hash, so items are immutable
  you can view Atlas as just reducing the size of Blockstack's Bitcoin transactions
  Atlas keeps the full DB in every server
- Gaia servers, storage server
  + separate storage area for each user (i.e. end-users)
  key -> value
  backed by Amazon S3, Dropbox, &c
    Gaia makes them all look the same
  most users use Gaia storage provided by Blockstack
  user's profile contains user's public key, per-app public keys
  user can have lots of other files, containing app data
  apps can sign and/or encrypt data in Gaia
- S3, Dropbox, &c
  + back-ends for Gaia
