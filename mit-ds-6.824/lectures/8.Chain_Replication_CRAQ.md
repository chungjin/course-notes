# 8.Chain Replication, CRAQ

## Overview

- Chain Replication, a very different approach from e.g. Raft.
- CRAQ's ability to read from **any** replica AND have strong consistency.

- What is Chian replication?
	```
	Have 4 servers in total
	S1, S2, S3, S4
	  S1 is "head"
	  S4 is "tail"
	```
	+ Writes:
		* Client sends to head
		* Forwarded down the chain, in order
		* Each server overwrites old data with new data
		* Tail responds to client
	+ Reads:
		* Client sends to tail
		* Tail responds (no other nodes involved)
- Failure recovery
	+ If head fails, successor takes over as head, no commited writes lost.
	+ If tail fails, predecessor takes over as tail, no writes lost.
	+ If intermediate fails, drop from chain, predecessor may need to re-send recent writes.
- Improvement of CRAQ
	+ tail may be the bottleneck as when read load is high
	+ CRAQ split objects over many chains, each server participates in multiple chains.	
	```
	C1: S1 S2 S3
    C2: S2 S3 S1
    C3: S3 S1 S2
	```
	+ This works if load is more or less evenly divided among chains. It often isn't. Maybe you could divide objects into even more chains, or use CRAQ's ideas.

-  Each replica stores a list of versions per object. One clean version, plus dirty version per recent write.
- Write:
    Client sends write to head.
    Replicas create new dirty version as write passes through.
    Tail creates clean version, ACKs back along chain, replicas turn "dirty" to "clean".
- Read from non-tail node:
    If latest version is clean, reply with that.
    Q: if latest is dirty, why not return most recent clean?
       (The Question. newer maybe already exposed to another reader!)
    Q: if latest is dirty, why not return that dirty version?
       (not committed, might disappear due to replica failure)
    If dirty, ask tail for latest version number ("version query").

## Drawbacks
- slow nodes can be the bottleneck
- 2nd node cannot take over as head if it can't reach the head, because it may caused by network partition.
