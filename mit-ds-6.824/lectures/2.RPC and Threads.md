# 2. RPC and Threads

## Threads

- What is thread?
	+ the threads share memory
	+ each thread include some per-thread state: program counter, registers, stack

- Pattern
	+ I/O concurrency
		* Client send request to many servers in parallel and waits for replies
		* Server processes multiple client requests, each request may block, like I/O waiting
	+ Multi-core performance
	+ Convenience: eg, health check

- Challenge
	- share data
		+ race condition
		+ avoid sharing mutable data
	- Coordination between threads
		+ producer/consumer pattern
		+ eg in golang: `go channels`, `sync.Cond`, `WaitGroup`
	- Deadlock	


## RPC(remote procedure call)
It is a way for client/server communication and hide details of network protocols


### Software Structure
```
Software structure
  client app        handler functions
   method stub       dispatcher
   RPC lib           RPC lib
     net  ------------ net
```

- Common
	Declare Args and Reply struct for each server to handler
- Client
	+ `connect()` to create a TCP connection to the server
	+ Call to ask the RPC library to perform the Call
		* required: server function name, arguments and place to put the reply
		* lib marshall args, send request, waits, unmarshalls reply
- Server
	+ server declare on Object with method as RPC handler
	+ register that object with RPC library
	+ accept TCP connections, dispatch to RPC lib
	+ RPC lib
		* read each request
		* create a new goroutine for this request
		* unmarshal request
		* looks up the method object(in table created by Register())
		* write reply on TCP connection
- Marshal
	+ format data into packets, support int, string, array, slice and object
	+ does not support channel or functions

## Failure Tolerance
Failure can be caused by lost packet, broken network, slow server, crashed server

### Best effort
- Procedure
	+ Client wait for response for a while
	+ if timeout, resend the request

- Issue
	+ code is not idempotent, eg: 
	```
	Client Put("k", 10)
	Client Put("k", 20)
	```

- Conclusion
	+ apply to read-only operations
	+ operations that do nothing if repeated, eg: DB checks if record has already been inserted.

### At Most Once
Server RPC code detects duplicate requests returns previous reply instead of re-running handler

- Implementation
	+ client includes unique ID with each request
	+ avoid duplicate ID for client
		* big random number
		* combine with ip address
- Failure tolerance when server crashes and restarts
if at-most-once duplicate info in memory, server will forget and accept duplicate requests after re-start
	+ snapshot the log
	+ stand by server for redundancy

- Go RPC library use "At Most Once" strategy
