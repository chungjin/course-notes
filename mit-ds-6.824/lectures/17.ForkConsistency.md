# Lecture 17: Fork Consistency, Certificate Transparency


## Background

Before certificates:
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks were a concern on the web, which redirect traffic
  - Fake DNS information
  - Redirect traffic to malicious server. Mallicious server will record the information you enter, and received from the real server.


After certificates, ssl, https:
- a certificate contains:
   DNS name e.g. "gmail.com"
   public key of that server
   identity of CA
   signature with CA's private key  
- when browser connects with https:
     server sends certificate to browser
     browser checks CA signature (using list of acceptable CA public keys)
     browser challenges server to prove it has private key

But CA maybe not reliable, how does Certificate Transparency (CT) approach this problem?
- it's really an audit system; it doesn't directly prohibit anything
- the main effect is to ensure that the existence of all certificates is public
- the basic action:
  > gmail.com asks CA for a certificate
  CA issues cert to gmail.com
  CA registers certificate with CT log server (typically more than one)
  **log server adds certificate to log**
  browser connects to gmail.com
  gmail.com provides certificate to browser
  **browser asks CT log server if cert is in the log**
- meanwhile
  > gmail.com's Monitor periodically fetches the entire CT log
  scans the log for all certs that say "gmail.com"
  complains if there are other than the one it knows about
  since those must be bogus
- thus both browsers and monitors see the same log,
  and monitors raise an alarm if there's a bogus cert in the log

## Consistency
how to ensure everyone sees the same log?

1. Merkle Tree: similar to git commit, each log attach with a hash value, `hash(new head) = hash(previous head, new commit)`.

2. STH Signed Tree Head: signed by log server

3. "Merkle Audit Proof":
consider a log with just two records, a and b.
  > browser asks "is a in the log?"
    server replies "0" and z=H(b) -- this is the proof
    brower checks H(H(a), z) = STH

  it is hard to hack if a is not in the log


4. Fork Attack or Equivocation:

  - action:
  B is the bogus, and send STH2 only to browser
  - How to prevent: gossip
    A gossip talk to serer, to get back STH periodically.
    Suppose there are two STHs, H1, H2.
    We need to prove H1 is the prefix of H2.
      + clients can compute H(H(H1,Hy1),Hy2) ... and check if equal to H2
      + y1, y2 is the log entry.
