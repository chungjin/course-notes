# FaRM, Optimistic Concurrency Control


## Two classes of concurrency control
Pessimistic (aka. two-phase locking):
- wait for lock on first use of object; hold until commit/abort
- called two-phase locking
- conflicts cause delays

Optimistic (aka. optimistic concurrency control (OCC)):
- read objects without locking
- don't install writes until commit
- commit "validates" to see if other xactions conflicted
- valid: commit the writes
- invalid: abort


- FaRM differ from Spanner?
  + Both replicate and use two-phase commit (2pc) for xactions.


## Network performance improvement

FaRm use `Kernel bypass` and `RDMA` for network performance improving.

### Why network communication so slow?
```
app                       app
---                       ---
socket buffers            buffers
TCP                       TCP
NIC driver                driver
NIC  -------------------- NIC
```
lots of expensive CPU operations:
- system calls
- copy messages
- interrupts
hard to build RPC than can deliver more than a few 100,000 / second

### Kernel Bypass
- Application directly interacts with NIC -- no system calls, no kernel
- NIC DMAs into/out of user RAM
- FaRM s/w polls DMA areas to check for new messages

### RDMA (remote direct memory access), it is one-sided.
Remote NIC directly reads/writes memory, use reliable protocol, with ACKs
- Sender provides memory address
- Remote CPU is not involved!
- Reads an entire cache line, atomically

One server's throughput: 10+ million/second, latency: 5 microseconds (from their NSDI 2014 paper)


## Optimistic Concurrency Control

1. Server memory layout
  + Region:
    * an array of objects
    * object layout:
      - header (high bit is lock flag, low bit is version#), to achieve `compare and swap` in one operation.
  + Incoming log
  + Incoming msg queue
  + all this in non-volatile RAM (i.e. written to SSD on power failure)

2. Diagram
```
tx.begin()
  Rx
  x = x+1
t.end()
```


- Read:
  + Client(TC) read data back(with version #) from server without lock
- Write:
  + Client(TC) append log to server side, log contains oid(object id) version #, new value
  + Server polls the log, check lock.
    * lock check, version check, and lock set are atomic
    using atomic compare-and-swap instruction.
    * If data is locked or version incompatible, reply no.
    * otherwise, reply yes
  + Client gather response from each server
    * if all yes, send out commit
    * otherwise, send out abort. Append ABORT to primaries' logs so they can release locks
- Primary process commit log
  + copy new value over object's memory
  + increment object's version #
  + clear object's lock flag
- Primary process abort log
  + release lock

3. Example:
  ```
  T1:    Rx0 Lx Cx
  T2: Rx0          Lx(receive no from primary, because data version incompatible)
  ```

  ```
  T1: Rx0  Lx(yes)  Cx
  T2:                  Rx0  Lx(yes)  Cx(succeeded!)
  ```

### Validation, optimization of read operation

VALIDATE = one-sided RDMA read to re-fetch object's version # and lock flag
  - if lock set, or version # changed since read, TC aborts
  - does not set the lock, thus faster than LOCK+COMMIT (save the data holding time between lock and commit)


Example:
```
x and y initially zero
T1:
  if x == 0:
    y = 1
T2:
  if y == 0:
    x = 1
(this is a classic test example for strong consistency)
T1,T2 yields y=1,x=0
T2,T1 yields x=1,y=0
aborts could leave x=0,y=0
but serializability forbids x=1,y=1
```

Scenario 1:
```
T1:  Rx  Ly  Vx  Cy
T2:  Ry  Lx  Vy  Cx
```
what will happen?
- the LOCKs will both succeed!
- the VALIDATEs will both fail, since lock bits are both set
- so both will abort -- which is OK


Scenario 2:
```
T1:  Rx  Ly  Vx      Cy
T2:  Ry          Lx  Vy  Cx
T1 commits
T2 aborts since T2's Vy sees T1's lock or higher version
```
