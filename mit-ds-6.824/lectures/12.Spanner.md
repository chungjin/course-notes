# 12 Spanner

Idea:
- Two-phase commit over Paxos.
- Synchronized time for fast r/o transactions.


Use case:
- Google F1 advertising database
- Previously sharded over many MYSQL and BigTable DBs; awkward
- Requirement:
  + Better(synchronous) replication
  + More flexible sharding
  + Cross-shard xactions
  + read-heavy workload
  + Strong consistency

## Paxos
- Replication managed by Paxos; one Paxos group per shard.
- Replicas are in different data centers.

The benefit of shard across data center:
- Sharding allows huge total throughput via parallelism.
  Datacenters fail independently -- different cities.
- Clients can read local replica -- fast!
  Can place replicas near relevant customers.
- Paxos requires only a majority -- tolerate slow/distant replicas.

Challenges:
- Read of local replica must yield fresh data. So it have the same overhead as Write request, vote via majority, It eliminate the benefit of locality.
- A transaction may involve multiple shards -> multiple Paxos groups.
- Transactions that read multiple records must be serializable. It means it need the assistance from Xaction Coordinator.

## Design for read improvement
In order to improve the read performance, the metric of Spanner:
- Read from local replicas, to avoid Paxos and cross-datacenter msgs.
- No locks, no two-phase commit, no transaction manager.

Question: How to guaranteen the read don't read stale data, and guaranteen the serializability of the DB?

Correctness constraints on r/o transactions:
- Serializable:
  + Same results as if transactions executed one-by-one.
      Even though they may actually execute concurrently.
  + I.e. an r/o xaction must essentially fit between r/w xactions, See all writes from prior transactions, nothing from subsequent.
- Externally consistent:
  + If T1 completes before T2 starts, T2 must see T1's writes.
  + "Before" refers to real (wall-clock) time. Similar to linearizable. Rules out reading stale data.

Example:
```
T1:  Wx(10)  Wy(9)  C
T2:                      Wx(8)  Wy(7)  C
T3:                    Rx(10)             Ry(9)
or:
T3:                    Rx(8)               Ry(7)
We want T3's reads to *all* occur at the *same* point relative to T1/T2.
```

### Snapshot Isolation (SI)
Assign every transaction a time-stamp.
- r/w: commit time.
- r/o: start time.

Example:
```
          x@10=9         x@20=8
          y@10=11        y@20=12
"@ 10" indicates the time-stamp.
T1 @ 10:  Wx  Wy  C
T2 @ 20:                 Wx  Wy  C
T3 @ 15:             Rx             Ry
```
Each replica group store multiple version of the data, together with timestamp.

For T3, Rx(15) = x@10 = 9, Ry(15) = y@10 = 11

Problem: what if T3 reads x from a replica that hasn't seen T1's write?
Solution: replica **"safe time"**.
  + Paxos leaders send writes in timestamp order.
  + Before serving a read at time 20, replica must see Paxos write for time > 20. So it knows it has seen all writes < 20.

## Time Synchronization
What goes wrong if clocks aren't synchronized exactly?
- No problem for r/w transactions, which use locks.
- If an r/o transaction's chosen TS is too large:
  + Its TS will be higher than replica safe times, and reads will block.
  + Correct but slow -- delay increased by amount of clock error.
- If an r/o transaction's chosen TS is too small:
  + It will miss writes that committed before the r/o xaction started.
  + Since its low TS will cause it to use old versions of records.
  This violates external consistency.
  ```
  Example of problem if r/o xaction's TS is too small:
  r/w T0 @  0: Wx1 C
  r/w T1 @ 10:         Wx2 C
  r/o T2 @  5:                   Rx(1)?
  Even T2 happens after T1, but the chosen timestamp is smaller than T2.
  ```

### True Time
- Time service yields a TTinterval = [ earliest, latest ].
- The correct time is guaranteed to be somewhere in the interval.
- Interval width computed from measured network delays, and is measured.


How Spanner ensures that if r/w T1 finishes before r/o T2 starts, TS1 < TS2?
- Start rule:
  + xaction TS = TT.now().latest
    * for r/o, at start time
    * for r/w, when commit begins
- Commit wait, for r/w xaction:
  + Before commit, delay until TS < TS.now().earliest
  + Guarantees that TS has passed.

Example:
```
r/w T0 @  0: Wx1 C
                 |1----------10| |11(commit wait)-----------20|
r/w T1 @ 10:         Wx2 P           C
                               |10--------12|
r/o T2 @ 12:                           Rx?
(P for prepare)

For T1, Commit delay until Ts.now().earliest<10, to guaranteen it really commits.
```


Why this provides external consistency:
- Commit wait means r/w TS is guaranteed to be in the past.
- r/o TS = TT.now().latest is guaranteed to be >= correct time.
  thus >= TS of any previous committed transaction (due to its commit wait)

## Perspective
- Snapshot Isolation gives you **serializable** r/o transactions.
  + Timestamps set an order.
  + Snapshot versions (and safe time) implement consistent reads at a timestamp.
  + Xaction sees all writes from lower-TS xactions, none from higher.
  + Any number will do for TS if you don't care about external consistency.
- Synchronized timestamps yield **external consistency**.
  + Even among transactions at different data centers.
  + Even though reading from local replicas that might lag.
