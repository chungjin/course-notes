# Package

## GOPATH

## Encode and decode
- [gob reference](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/)

Gob manages streams of gobs - binary values exchanged between an Encoder (transmitter) and a Decoder (receiver). A typical use is transporting arguments and results of remote procedure calls (RPCs) such as those provided by package "net/rpc".
